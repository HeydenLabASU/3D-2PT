Installation instructions
requirements: installed single precision FFTW3 library (www.fftw.org)

To compile the 3D-2PT executables, download the files in this repository and type:

$ make

To get started with 3D-2PT calculations, enter the "test-system" directory
$ cd test-system
The following software is required to run the test simulations:
- gromacs (www.gromacs.org)
- VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics, http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd)

The test system consists of a sodium and a chloride ion separated by 3.0A in water.
Enter the corresponding sub-directory:

$ cd NaCl-3.00A

Execute the automated scripts in the sequence described in Flowchart.pdf
